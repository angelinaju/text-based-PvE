While working on this project, I realized that the functionality of the game loop turned out better than how I expected it. I was a bit confused at first on how to create the loop with different interactive features, 
so I looked at some other game references for inspiration and ideas. I think I did a fairly decent job with my usage of classes and functions, as I was originally going to make a different class for each monster but 
realized that I could combine them all into one. The implementation of Visual Studio Code and Github also allowed me to practice a bit with using the GitHub Desktop app.

When I was trying to figure out how to access the map of player attacks, I didn't want the player to have to type out the full name of the move in order to make the move, as I thought pressing 1, 2, or 3 would be easier. 
I was stuck on this issue for a little bit, but I eventually found some documentation on Geeks4Geeks that explained how to copy a map into a vector of pairs, which would allow me to access the key value pairs by index. 
This allows the player to simply input 1, 2, or 3 as their choice and these numbers will correspond to a particular attack and damage number automatically. 

I enjoyed learning how to properly use the GitHub Desktop app and seeing my progress on my GitHub account, as this is technically my first "from scratch" C++ project. I also learned about the basics of game development, 
something I have been trying to start. While I know that my project is probably not as technically complex as others, I believe my implementation of maps & vectors and my attempts to make game logic slightly better through
the randomness of monster attacks and gold drops are beneficial when it comes to my knowledge of how to create an entertaining, fair, and balanced game. I think being able to practice all of this has been incredibly helpful
for my future in game development and programming.
